# Sprint 1

### User stories

As an investor, I want to be able to see which stocks I have investments in first, so that it is easier for me to check on my investments.

As an investor, I want to receive a notification if a threshold of either value or percentage is crossed, so that I can know if I need to either buy or sell my investment

As an investor, I want to be able to see which stock has increased by the most percentage, so that I know which companies have been doing the best over the past day/week/month

As an investor, I would want to be able to look up certain stocks by their stock ticker or name, so that I can find specific companies and how they are performing

As a user, I want to be able to make my own account, so that I can login from different devices and view the different stocks I have favorited

As a user, I want to be able to see the stock graph that looks very similar to Google's market summary and color itself green or red depending on if it's price has increased or decrease, in order to be able to identify a stock's performance at a glance.

As a user, I want to be able to input investments from different sources and be able to see the total valuation of my investments across all my accounts.
As a user, I want to receive personalized recommendations based on the stocks I currently have in my portfolio.

As a user, I want to be able to create an account on the app using my first name, last name and email address and have my account information stored in a database.

What issues your team planned to address:  
Backend: On the backend side, the team planned to create an API and a database that would be able to store information provided by users looking to use the application.

Which ones were successfully completed:  
The backend team was able to complete the task, generating a database table to hold the user's info, notably their first and last names as well as their email address. Another table was also created to store information about different stocks that the user would input into the application.

Which ones didn't and why?  
The rest of the issues were not completed as they all required the API and database to be completed first. The rest of the issues will be handled in future sprints.
