### Backend
### Frontend

On the front end, we decided to start working on the charts that would present data like the distribution of assets in a user's portfolio
and it's performance overall.

Along with that, front end was able to submit a form through the login that would sent the username, password, and email to the backend,
allowing for storage of user's data.

Tests were also done on the components of the front end like the separate pages that were made to see the charts, login, and homepage.
