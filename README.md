# Portfullio

Our project is to develop a financial investments dashboard to organize, visualize, track your investments of different types. Our dashboard is an organized way to view your stocks, crypto, and savings accounts all in one place.

## Running the program

To run this program, you will have to have Node.js installed to run the localhost web app on your browser.

For more information on installing Node.js, see

### https://nodejs.org/en

Once node.js is installed, clone our respoitory in your folder of choice. Navigate to the "Portfullio"
folder and run "npm install"

On top of that, you will have to install highcharts, which is a library that we used to present charts like
your portfolio's performance and distribution of assets.

To install, run "npm install --save highcharts"

After all the Node.js packages and highcharts library have been installed, run ng serve.

Make sure you are in the "Portfullio" directory. This will get the localhost webapp running.

Once the command is done running, there will be a localhost url that you can ctrl+click on to access or
copy into your browser.

This will give allow you to see the app on the localhost url, so once you open it on your browser you are
able to use our application.
